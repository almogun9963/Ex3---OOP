Ex3 - OOP

in this project we will updrade our last project about graphs.
we will take our last project and make a game that based on graphs.
in this game we have robots (between 1 and 5 robots) and fruits (apples and bannanas) and 24 scenarios.
in every scenario, the porpose of each robot is to collect as many points as he can (every fruit has a diffrent score), in the given time (30 or 60 sec).
we give the player to choose between playing manually(the player chooses everything) or playing automaticly(the algorithms chooses everyting).
